BATTLESHIP

Instructions:

1. Select the PLAYME.py file and press the green button

2.Press play

3. Select game mode: Classic, or with Powerups

Classic:

Use the mouse and click to shot. Upon clicking, the computer will automatically take a random shot.
If you hit the enemy ship, it will turn red (one shot, one kill, all luck, no skill)
If the computer hits your ship, it will turn blue. 
Your shots will be marked with white squares, just becuse your ship is there, doesn't mean the enemy ship is behind it. 
Each player gets 4 ships automaticaly placed on the grid at random. 2 vertical, and 2 horizontal.


Power Up:

Just like classic, but there are 3 power up blocks randomly placed and with random colors. 
One block will display all the ships on the screen until you lose a ship
One block will respawn one of your ships from the dead
One block will turn on friendly fire, allowing you to kill your own ships
Choose Wisely.....
